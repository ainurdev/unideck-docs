# Create and Edit Dashboards

UniDeck lets you build **multiple dashboards**, each tailored for a different focus. Like work, personal planning, team operations, or data monitoring.

At the bottom of your screen, you’ll find the **dashboard control bar,** your central place to switch, create, and customize dashboards.

### Navigating Dashboards

In the bottom bar (see image above), you'll see:

* **Active Dashboard Name** (e.g., “UniDeck Dashboard”)
* Other dashboards (e.g., "Home")
* A **plus button (+)** to create new dashboards
* A **three-dot menu** next to each dashboard name for more options

Clicking on any dashboard tab instantly switches your view, no reloads or data loss.

### Pro Tips

* You can switch dashboards at any time, your layout and data stay intact.
* Use dashboards to separate your life into focused spaces: e.g., _Personal_, _Team_, _Analytics_, or _Quick Links_.
* Combine dashboard switching with **AI insights** and **widget sets** to get even more out of your layout.
