# Customize Your First Dashboard

Welcome to your **UniDeck's Home Dashboard,** a personalized workspace designed to help you focus, plan, and create from day one.

As soon as you sign up, UniDeck automatically generates a ready-to-use “Home” dashboard. This includes a handpicked set of widgets you can immediately interact with, helping you understand the platform through hands-on exploration.

The **default layout** includes a variety of helpful widgets:

* 📆 **Calendar** – View your agenda at a glance
* ⏳ **Focus Timer** – Stay productive with Pomodoro-style sessions
* 📬 **Inbox** – Connect to Google to read and manage your emails
* 📝 **To-Do List** – Start organizing your tasks
* 💡 **Quote of the Day** – Kick off with a little inspiration
* 🖼️ **App Launcher Widget** – Quick access buttons to open websites or apps

These widgets are draggable, resizable, and removable. Feel free to move things around and make it yours.

***

### Drag. Drop. Done.

Customizing your layout is simple:

* **Click and hold** any widget to move it around
* **Right click** to open context menu for changing sizes
* **Click the ⚙ icon** in the top-right of some widget to access settings or configure

Try building a layout that matches your flow, whether it’s a compact focus space or a broad overview dashboard.

### Top Navigation Features

At the top of your dashboard, you’ll find a **minimalist bar** that blends utility with elegance:

* 🌞 **Personalized Greeting** – Changes throughout the day
* 🕰️ **Live Clock & Date** – Always in sync
* 🔍 **Search the Web** – Instantly search from your dashboard via the built-in bar

You can toggle or customize these elements later for a cleaner or more focused look.

### Customize Your Background

Want your dashboard to feel more “you”? On the **left-hand side**, you’ll notice a vertical menu that allows for full aesthetic control:

* 🌄 **Switch Random Background** – Click and Up and Down arrows to switch the background
* 🧱 **Custom Background** – Hover on one of the arrows and click the settings gear.
