# Configure Your Widgets

## Configure Your Widgets

Every widget in **UniDeck** is designed to be flexible, not only in how it looks, but also in how it behaves. Whether you‚Äôre setting up a Focus Timer or an Advanced Table, you can fine-tune each widget to better suit your personal workflow.

This guide shows you how to use the **right-click context menu** and the **configuration modals** available in select widgets.

***

### Right-Click Context Menu

Right-clicking on any widget opens a **context menu**, which may include up to three sections depending on the widget‚Äôs features.

#### 1. Widget-Specific Settings (üü© Top Section)

Used for widgets that support filters, visual and sound customization, and etc.

* **Example**: In the Clock widget, you can choose to ‚ÄúShow Seconds‚Äù or switch between display types like "Simple", "Scrolling", or "Binary".
* Some widgets may let you choose data views, styles, or filtering preferences here.

#### 2. Size & Configure (üü• Middle Section)

Resize or customize the behavior of your widget:

* **Size**: Choose from preset grid sizes such as 1x1, 2x1, or 2x2 depending on how much screen space you want to dedicate.
* **Configure**: Launches a **detailed configuration modal** (if available) where you can fine-tune settings.

#### 3. Misc Options (ü©∑ Bottom Section)

Additional actions include:

* **Learn More**: Opens help or documentation about this widget
* **Delete**: Remove the widget from your dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
Not all widgets have all three sections, simpler widgets may only offer size and delete options.
{% endhint %}

### Configuration Modals

Widgets with more advanced functionality offer a dedicated **Configuration modal** for deeper customization. These appear when selecting ‚ÄúConfigure‚Äù from the context menu.

#### Time Widget Configuration Example

The Time widget lets you:

* Choose a **Display Style** (Simple / Scrolling / Binary)
* Select a **Timezone** for that clock (great for remote teams!)

This makes it easy to keep multiple clocks in different styles and zones on one dashboard.

#### üìÑ Advanced Table Widget Configuration Example

The **Advanced Table** widget offers an intuitive table editor to what you're used to from tools like Google Sheets and MS Excel integrated within your UniDeck dashboard for showcasing custom structured data.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This is one of our most advanced widgets so don't worry about it at this point. This is only a showcase here.
{% endhint %}

* **Table view**
* **Column data formatting**
* **Column view and look customization**
* **Automatic and manual data array selection from response**

### Tips

* Use configuration to **adapt widgets to your routine**, not the other way around.
* Want different versions of the same widget? You can duplicate and configure each one independently.
* Resize widgets after configuring them to make your layout cleaner and more useful.
