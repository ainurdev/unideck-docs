### Team Collaboration with Profiles

For users on the **Team Plan**, UniDeck enhances collaborative efforts:

* **Profile Sharing**: Share specific profiles with team members to ensure everyone has access to the same tools and information.
* **Real-Time Collaboration**: Collaborate simultaneously within shared profiles, with changes reflecting instantly for all members.
* **Permission Settings**: Control access levels by assigning roles, determining who can view or modify shared profiles.

By effectively utilizing profiles, UniDeck enables you to compartmentalize different areas of your life or work, providing a streamlined and organized dashboard experience tailored to your diverse needs.
