# Why Use UniDeck?

UniDeck is your all-in-one, no-code platform designed to streamline your workflow by centralizing your essential tools into a single, intuitive interface. Whether you're a freelancer juggling multiple projects or part of a large enterprise coordinating complex tasks, UniDeck adapts to your needs, enhancing productivity and collaboration at every level.&#x20;

### From Simple Dashboards to Complex Systems

Getting started with UniDeck takes just a few minutes. You can connect your Google Workspaces, GitHub, Zoom or Apple accounts to build a personalized hub that shows your emails, meetings, and tasks in one place. With a few clicks, you can:

* Check unread emails across accounts
* View upcoming events and meetings
* See weather forecasts, news feeds, and to-dos

But UniDeck goes far beyond widgets.

Our advanced components like **Graph**, **Table**, and **API Integrator** let you connect real-time data sources, query APIs, and visualize metrics, just like you would in tools like Grafana or Tableau, but with less friction and no code required.

### Replace Siloed Tools with One Workspace

Traditional dashboards are often tied to a specific toolset or team. UniDeck takes a different approach: it's **tool-agnostic and user-centric**.

* Want to monitor your server logs, app metrics, or marketing KPIs?
* Need a central place to track Jira issues, emails, meetings, or GitHub pull requests?
* Or just want a calming new tab page that greets you with your schedule and a weather widget?

UniDeck lets you create that, all in one place, visually.

### Built for Everyone, From Makers to Teams

UniDeck was designed with both beginners and power users in mind:

* **No-code interface**: drag-and-drop, edit inline, and publish with ease
* **Powerful integrations**: REST APIs, custom widgets, and data fetchers
* **Team-ready**: collaborate on dashboards, create shared views, or build templates for others

Whether you're a solo founder, a DevOps engineer replacing your Grafana stack, or just someone who wants a calmer browser new tab, UniDeck is flexible enough to grow with you.

### One Platform, Unlimited Potential

UniDeck is not another dashboard tool. It’s a platform for building **personal workspaces**, **team control panels**, and **automated data views** that adapt to your flow.

What you build with UniDeck is entirely up to you. But one thing is clear: once you start using it, you'll wonder how you managed without it.
