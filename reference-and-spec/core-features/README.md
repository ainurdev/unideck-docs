# Core Features

Widgets are the building blocks of your UniDeck dashboards. But all of these widgets are able to work together because of the core backbone of UniDeck. The core functionalities documented in this section are the features that make UniDeck become your smart dashboard and assistant.

### API Hub

The API Hub is the heart of UniDeck's advanced widgets and custom data insights. It allows you to connect to any HTTP API and use the data in your dashboards.

You have probably used tools like Postman, Insomnia, or even curl to test APIs before. The API Hub is similar to these tools, but it is designed to be used in your dashboards. You can use the API Hub to connect to any HTTP API as a data source and use the data in your widgets.

### AI Insights

The AI Insights feature allows you to use the power of AI to generate insights from your data. At UniDeck we develop our own In-House AI models that can be used as a provider for this feature, but you can also use any other providers like OpenAI ChatGPT or Google Gemini.

Our In-House models are also offered to our Enterprise customers as a private model, which means that the model is trained on your data and is not shared with any other customers and can be hosted on your own premises or cloud infrastructure.
