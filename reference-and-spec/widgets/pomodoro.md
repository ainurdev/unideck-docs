This widget helps you maintain concentration and prevent burnout, making it ideal for tasks such as studying, working, or any activity that benefits from structured time intervals.

### Widget Size

To provide an optimal balance between functionality and space utilization, the Pomodoro Widget is available exclusively in a **Medium** size, ensuring clear visibility and ease of interaction on your dashboard.
