# Share Dashboards with Team

UniDeck allows you to share your dashboards with your team to streamline collaboration and give everyone access to shared context and data, without sacrificing control.

This feature makes it easy to give visibility into your workflows while maintaining full ownership of the dashboard.

***

### How Sharing Works

* When you share a dashboard, team members can **view** the dashboard and its widgets.
* Only the **dashboard owner** can make edits to the layout or widgets.
* Integrations used in the shared widgets (e.g., Google Calendar or Gmail) will remain linked to the original account, but are visible to the team.

***

### How to Share a Dashboard

1. Locate the dashboard tab in the **bottom control bar**.
2. Click the **three dots** next to the dashboard you want to share.
3. Select **"Share with Team"** from the dropdown menu.

### Share Dashboard Modal

After clicking **Share with Team**, you’ll see the **Share Dashboard** modal.

Here’s what it includes:

#### Select a Team

* You’ll see a list of **teams you own or are a member of**.
* Simply click on the team you want to share the dashboard with.
* Once shared, team members will be able to **view the dashboard and its widgets**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only one team can be selected per dashboard at a time.
{% endhint %}

#### Integrated Widgets View

On the right side of the modal, you'll see a list of:

* **Widgets that are using integrations**
* The **accounts linked** to those integrations

This allows you to review what kind of data team members will see when accessing the dashboard.

### Access Rights

* **View-Only**: Shared dashboards are view-only for all team members.
* **Ownership**: You retain full control and ownership of the dashboard.
* **Integration Data**: Only the widget output is shared, team members do not gain access to your integration credentials.

***

### Tips

* You can **revoke sharing** at any time by returning to the same menu and selecting a different team or removing access.
* Make sure any sensitive data within widgets is appropriate for team visibility.
* For better clarity, consider naming your dashboards descriptively (e.g., "Marketing Overview", "DevOps KPIs").

Sharing dashboards makes your UniDeck workspace a powerful hub for collaboration. Keep your team aligned, informed, and working from the same source of truth, without ever needing to send a screenshot or export a PDF.
