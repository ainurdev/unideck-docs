### Filling Out the Team Form

Inside the **Create Team** modal (as shown in the screenshot), you'll see the following fields:

#### Team Name

* Enter a unique name for your team.
* This will help you distinguish it from other teams you might create or join.

#### Members

* Enter the email address of each user you'd like to invite.
* You can **invite multiple people at once** by separating email addresses with commas.
* Example:\
  `john@example.com,jane@example.com,bob@example.com`

After entering email addresses, click the **Invite** button to queue the users for your team.

Click **Submit** to finalize the creation of your team.

All invited users will receive an email or in-app notification to accept the invitation and join your team.

### What Happens Next

After your team is created:

* You become the **Team Owner**
* The team appears in the **Teams** section of your profile menu
* You can now **share dashboards**, **assign access rights**, and **collaborate using shared premium features**

***

### Tips

* All team members must have a UniDeck account to access shared dashboards.
* You can update your team, add/remove members, or manage permissions at any time from the Teams panel.
* To upgrade your team to a premium plan, refer to the Team Billing & Management section.
