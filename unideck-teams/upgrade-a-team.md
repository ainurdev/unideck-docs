### Pricing Model

Pricing is based on the number of **active seats** in your team.

* Add more team members to increase your team's access, your billing total updates accordingly.
* Remove members to reduce your seat usage and future billing.

UniDeck only charges for **active team members**.

### Things to Know

* Billing is handled at the team level, not individually per user.
* Upgrading includes a 14-day money-back guarantee.
* The Team Owner is responsible for managing billing and seat count.
