# Manage Team Members

Once you've created a team in **UniDeck**, managing its members is simple and flexible. You can rename your team, invite new collaborators, and remove existing members, all from a single interface.

***

### Accessing Team Management

To manage your team:

1. Go to the bottom **control-bar** and click on your **profile** in the bottom-right corner.
2. Under the **Teams** section in the profile context menu, you'll see a list of teams you belong to.
3. Click the **gear icon** next to any team to open its **management modal**.

### Using the Team Management Modal

The **Manage Team** modal gives you full control over your team’s membership and identity.

#### Rename Your Team

At the top of the modal, you can update the **Team Name** field to rename your team at any time. Changes apply immediately after clicking **Submit**.

***

#### Add Team Members

1. Enter one or more email addresses in the input field.
2. Use commas to invite multiple members at once.
   * Example:\
     `john@example.com,jane@example.com,bob@example.com`
3. Click the **Invite** button to send invitations.

Invited users will receive an email or in-app prompt to accept and join the team.

***

#### View and Remove Members

Each team member is listed below the invite input, showing:

* Their email address
* The date they joined or were invited

To remove a team member, click the **"X" icon** next to their entry.

### Notes

* You must be the **Team Owner** to rename the team or manage members.
* Pending invitations will appear in the list until accepted or removed.
* There is no limit to the number of members you can invite unless restricted by your team’s subscription plan.

Keeping your team list up to date ensures the right people have access to the right [dashboards](https://dash.unideck.app/). Invite collaborators as needed, and remove members when roles change, all in just a few clicks.
